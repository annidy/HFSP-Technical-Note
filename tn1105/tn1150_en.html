         <p>HFS Plus is a volume format for Mac OS. HFS
         Plus was introduced with <a href="http://developer.apple.com/technotes/tn/tn1121.html#HFS%20Plus">Mac
         OS 8.1</a>. HFS Plus is architecturally very similar to
         HFS, although there have been a number of changes. The

         <p>The extent to which these HFS Plus features are available
         through a programming interface is OS dependent. Mac OS versions
         less than 9.0 do not provide programming interfaces for any
         HFS Plus-specific features.</p>
         
         <p>To summarize, the key goals that guided the design of the
         HFS Plus volume format were:</p>
         
         <ul>
            <li>efficient use of disk space,</li>
            <li>international-friendly file names,</li>          
            <li>future support for named forks, and</li>
            <li>ease booting on non-Mac OS operating systems.</li>
         </ul>
         
         <p>The following sections describes these goals, and the
         differences between HFS and HFS Plus required to meet these
         goals.</p>
         
         <h3>Efficient Use of Disk Space</h3>
         
         <p>HFS divides the total space on a volume into equal-sized
         pieces called allocation blocks. It uses 16-bit fields to
         identify a particular allocation block, so there must be
         less than 2<sup>16</sup> (65,536) allocation blocks on an
         HFS volume. The size of an allocation block is typically the
         smallest multiple of 512 such that there are less than
         65,536 allocation blocks on the volume (i.e., the volume
         size divided by 65,535, rounded up to a multiple of 512).
         Any non-empty fork must occupy an integral number of
         allocation blocks. This means that the amount of space
         occupied by a fork is rounded up to a multiple of the
         allocation block size. As volumes (and therefore allocation
         blocks) get bigger, the amount of allocated but unused space
         increases.</p>
         
         <p>HFS Plus uses 32-bit values to identify allocation
         blocks. This allows up to 2 <sup>32</sup> (4,294,967,296)
         allocation blocks on a volume. More allocation blocks means
         a smaller allocation block size, especially on volumes of 1
         GB or larger, which in turn means less average wasted space
         (the fraction of an allocation block at the end of a fork,
         where the entire allocation block is not actually used). It
         also means you can have more files, since the available
         space can be more finely distributed among a larger number
         of files. This change is especially beneficial if the volume
         contains a large number of small files.</p>
         
         <h3>International-Friendly File Names</h3>
         
         <p>HFS uses 31-byte strings to store file names. HFS does
         not store any kind of script information with the file name
         to indicate how it should be interpreted. File names are
         compared and sorted using a routine that assumes a Roman
         script, wreaking havoc for names that use some other script
         (such as Japanese). Worse, this algorithm is buggy, even for
         Roman scripts. The Finder and other applications interpret
         the file name based on the script system in use at runtime.
         </p>
         
<center><table border="0" width="550">
<tbody><tr><td bgcolor="#E6E6E6">
<p><b>Note:</b><br>
                  
                  The problem with using non-Roman scripts in an HFS
                  file name is that HFS compares file names in a case-
                  insensitive fashion. The case-insensitive
                  comparison algorithm assume a MacRoman encoding.
                  When presented with non-Roman text, this algorithm
                  fails in strange ways. The upshot is that HFS
                  decides that certain non-Roman file names are
                  duplicates of other file names, even though they
                  are not duplicates in the source encoding.</p>
</td></tr></tbody></table></center>
         
         <p>HFS Plus uses up to 255 Unicode characters to store file
         names. Allowing up to 255 characters makes it easier to have
         very descriptive names. Long names are especially useful
         when the name is computer-generated (such as Java class
         names).</p>
         
         <p>The HFS catalog B-tree uses 512-byte nodes. An HFS Plus
         file name can occupy up to 512 bytes (including the length
         field). Since a B-tree index node must store at least two
         keys (plus pointers and node descriptor), the HFS Plus
         catalog must use a larger node size. The typical node size
         for an HFS Plus catalog B-tree is 4 KB.</p>
         
         <p>In the HFS catalog B-tree, the keys stored in an index
         node always occupy a fixed amount of space, the maximum key
         size. In HFS Plus, the keys in an index node may occupy a
         variable amount of space determined by the actual size of
         the key. This allows for less wasted space in index nodes
         and creates, on typical disks, a substantially larger
         branching factor in the tree (requiring fewer node accesses
         to find any given record).</p>
         
         <h3>Future Support for Named Forks</h3>
         
         <p>Files on an HFS volume have two forks: a data fork and a
         resource fork, either of which may be empty (zero length).
         Files and directories also contain a small amount of
         additional information (known as catalog information or
         metadata) such as the modification date or Finder info.</p>
         
         <p>Apple software teams and third-party developers often
         need to store information associated with particular files
         and directories. In some cases (for example, custom icons for
         files), the data or resource fork is appropriate. But in
         other cases (for example, custom icons for directories, or File
         Sharing access privileges), using the data or resource fork
         is not appropriate or not possible.</p>
         
         <p>A number of products have implemented special-purpose
         solutions for storing their file- and directory-related
         data. But because these are not managed by the file system,
         they can become inconsistent with the file and directory
         structure.</p>
         
         <p>HFS Plus has an attribute file, another B-tree, that can
         be used to store additional information for a file or
         directory. Since it is part of the volume format, this
         information can be kept with the file or directory as is it
         moved or renamed, and can be deleted when the file or
         directory is deleted. The contents of the attribute file's
         records have not been fully defined yet, but the goal is to
         provide an arbitrary number of forks, identified by Unicode
         names, for any file or directory.</p>

                  Because the attributes file has not been fully

                  delete named forks when a file or directory is

                  delete named forks will need to check for these
                  orphaned named forks and delete them when the
                  volume is mounted. The
                  <code>lastMountedVersion</code> field of the volume
                  header can be used to detect when such a check
                  needs to take place.</p>

         <h3>Easy Startup of Alternative Operating Systems</h3>
         
         <p>HFS Plus defines a special <strong>startup file</strong>,
         an unstructured fork that can be found easily during system
         startup. The location and size of the startup file is
         described in the <a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/technotes/tn/tn1150.html#VolumeHeader">volume header</a>.
         The startup file is especially useful on systems that don't
         have HFS or HFS Plus support in ROM. In many respects, the
         startup file is a generalization of the HFS boot blocks, one
         that provides a much larger, variable-sized amount of
         storage.</p>

         </ul>
         
         <p>Each of these complex structures is described in its own
         section. The purpose of this section is to give an overview
         of the volume format, describe how the structures fit
         together, and define the primitive data types used by HFS
         Plus.</p>
         
         <h3>Terminology</h3>
         
         <p>HFS Plus is a specification of how a <b>volume</b> (files
         that contain user data, along with the structure to retrieve
         that data) exists on a <b>disk</b> (the medium on which user
         data is stored).  The storage space on a disk is divided into
         units called <b>sectors</b>.  A sector is the smallest
         part of a disk that the disk's driver software will read or write
         in a single operation (without having to read or write additional
         data before or after the requested data).  The size of a sector is
         usually based on the way the data is physically laid out on the disk.
         For hard disks, sectors are typically 512 bytes.  For optical media,
         sectors are typically 2048 bytes.</p>
         
         <p>Most of the data structures on an HFS Plus volume do not
         depend on the size of a sector, with the exception of the
         <a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/technotes/tn/tn1150.html#Journal">journal</a>.  Because the journal does rely
         on accessing individual sectors, the sector size is stored
         in the <code>jhdr_size</code> field of the
         <a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/technotes/tn/tn1150.html#JournalHeader">journal header</a> (if the
         volume has a journal).</p>
         
         <p>HFS Plus allocates space in units called <b>allocation
         blocks</b>; an allocation block is simply a group of
         consecutive bytes. The size (in bytes) of an allocation
         block is a power of two, greater than or equal to 512, which
         is set when the volume is initialized. This value cannot be
         easily changed without reinitializing the volume. Allocation
         blocks are identified by a 32-bit <b>allocation block
         number</b>, so there can be at most 2<sup>32</sup>
         allocation blocks on a volume. Current implementations of the
         file system are optimized for 4K allocation blocks.</p>
         
<center><table border="0" width="550">
<tbody><tr><td bgcolor="#E6E6E6">
<p><b>Note:</b><br>                  
                  For the best performance, the allocation block size should
                  be a multiple of the sector size.  If the
                  volume has an <a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/technotes/tn/tn1150.html#HFSWrapper">HFS wrapper</a>, the
                  wrapper's allocation block size and allocation block start
                  should also be multiples of the sector size to
                  allow the best performance.</p>
</td></tr></tbody></table></center>

         <p>All of the volume's structures, including the volume
         header, are part of one or more allocation blocks (with the possible
         exception of the alternate volume header, discussed
         <a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/technotes/tn/tn1150.html#OddSizeVolumes">below</a>). This differs from HFS,
         which has several structures (including the boot blocks, master
         directory block, and bitmap) which are not part of any
         allocation block.</p>
         
         <p><a name="Clump"></a>To promote file contiguity and avoid
         fragmentation, disk space is typically allocated to files in
         groups of allocation blocks, or <b>clumps</b>. The clump size
         is always a multiple of the allocation block size. The default
         clump size is specified in the volume header.</p>

<p><b>IMPORTANT:</b><br>
                  
                  The actual algorithm used to extend files is not part
                  of this specification. The implementation is not
                  required to act on the clump values in the volume
                  header; it merely provides space to store those
                  values.</p>

                  It will extend its allocation up to a multiple of
                  the clump size if there is sufficient free space
                  contiguous with the end of the requested
                  allocation. Space is not allocated in contiguous

                  </td></tr></tbody></table></center>
         
         <p>Every HFS Plus volume must have a <b>volume header</b>.
         The volume header contains sundry information about the
         volume, such as the date and time of the volume's creation
         and the number of files on the volume, as well as the
         location of the other key structures on the volume. The
         volume header is always located at 1024 bytes from the
         start of the volume.</p>
         
         <p>A copy of the volume header, known as the <b>alternate
         volume header</b>, is stored starting at 1024 bytes before
         the end of the volume. The first 1024 bytes of volume
         (before the volume header), and the last 512 bytes of the
         volume (after the alternate volume header) are
         <a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/technotes/tn/tn1150.html#ReservedAndPadFields">reserved</a>.
         All of the allocation blocks containing the volume header,
         alternate volume header, or the reserved areas before the
         volume header or after the alternate volume header, are marked
         as used in the <a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/technotes/tn/tn1150.html#AllocationFile">allocation file</a>.
         The actual number of allocation blocks marked this way depends
         on the allocation block size.</p>
         
         <p>An HFS Plus volume contains five <b>special files</b>,
         which store the file system structures required to access
         the file system payload: folders, <b>user files</b>, and
         attributes. The special files are the catalog file, the
         extents overflow file, the allocation file, the attributes
         file and the startup file. Special files only have a single
         fork (the data fork) and the extents of that fork are
         described in the volume header.</p>
         
         <p>The <b>catalog file</b> is a special file that describes
         the folder and file hierarchy on a volume. The catalog file
         contains vital information about all the files and folders
         on a volume, as well as the <b>catalog information</b>, for
         the files and folders that are stored in the catalog file.
         The catalog file is organized as a B-tree (or "balanced
         tree") to allow quick and efficient searches through a large
         folder hierarchy.</p>
         
         <p>The catalog file stores the file and folder names, which
         consist of up to 255 Unicode characters, as described
         <a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/technotes/tn/tn1150.html#HFSPlusNames">below</a>.</p>
         
<center><table border="0" width="550">

<p><b>Note:</b><br>                  
The <a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/technotes/tn/tn1150.html#BTrees">B-Trees</a> section contains
an in-depth description of the B-trees used by HFS
Plus.</p></td></tr></tbody></table></center>
         
         <p>The <b>attributes file</b> is another special file which
         contains additional data for a file or folder. Like the
         catalog file, the attributes file is organized as a B-tree.
         In the future, it will be used to store information about
         additional forks. (This is similar to the way the catalog
         file stores information about the data and resource forks of
         a file.)</p>
         
         <p>HFS Plus tracks which allocation blocks belong to a fork
         by maintaining a list of the fork's extents. An
         <b>extent</b> is a contiguous range of allocation blocks
         allocated to some fork, represented by a pair of numbers:
         the first allocation block number and the number of
         allocation blocks. For a user file, the first eight extents
         of each fork are stored in the volume's catalog file. Any
         additional extents are stored in the <b>extents overflow
         file</b>, which is also organized as a B-tree.</p>
         
         <p>The extents overflow file also stores additional extents
         for the special files except for the extents overflow file
         itself. However, if the startup file requires more than the
         eight extents in the Volume Header (and thus requires
         additional extents in the extents overflow file), it would
         be much harder to access, and defeat the purpose of the
         startup file. So, in practice, a startup file should be
         allocated such that it doesn't need additional extents in
         the extents overflow file.</p>
         
         <p>The <b>allocation file</b> is a special file which
         specifies whether an allocation block is used or free. This
         performs the same role as the HFS volume bitmap, although
         making it a file adds flexibility to the volume format.</p>
         
         <p>The <b>startup file</b> is another special file which
         facilitates booting of non-Mac OS computers from HFS Plus
         volumes.</p>
         
         <p>Finally, the <b>bad block file</b> prevents the volume
         from using certain allocation blocks because the portion of
         the media that stores those blocks is defective. The bad
         block file is neither a special file nor a user file; this
         is merely convention used in the extents overflow file. See
         <a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/technotes/tn/tn1150.html#BadBlockFile">Bad Block File</a> for more details.

         <h3>Broad Structure</h3>
         
         <p>The bulk of an HFS Plus volume consists of seven types of
         information or areas:</p>
         
         <ol>
            <li>user file forks,</li>
            
            <li>the allocation file (bitmap),</li>
            
            <li>the catalog file,</li>
            
            <li>the extents overflow file,</li>
            
            <li>the attributes file,</li>
            
            <li>the startup file, and</li>
            
            <li>unused space.</li>
         </ol>
         
         <p>The general structure of an HFS Plus volume is
         illustrated in Figure 1.</p>

         <p>The volume header is always at a fixed
         location (1024 bytes from the start of the volume).
         However, the special files can appear anywhere between
         the volume header block and the alternate volume header
         block. These files can appear in any order and are not
         necessarily contiguous.</p>
         
         <p>The information on HFS Plus volumes (with the possible
         exception of the alternate volume header, as discussed
         <a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/technotes/tn/tn1150.html#OddSizeVolumes">below</a>) is organized solely
         in allocation blocks. Allocation blocks are simply a means
         of grouping space on the media into convenient parcels.
         The size of an allocation block is a power of two,
         and at least 512. The allocation block size is a volume
         header parameter whose value is set when the volume is
         initialized; it cannot be changed easily without
         reinitializing the volume.</p>

<p><b>Note:</b><br>                  
                  The allocation block size is a classic
                  speed-versus- space tradeoff. Increasing the
                  allocation block size decreases the size of the
                  allocation file, and often reduces the number of
                  separate extents that must be manipulated for every
                  file. It also tends to increase the average size of
                  a disk I/O, which decreases overhead. Decreasing
                  the allocation block size reduces the average
                  number of wasted bytes per file, making more
                  efficient use of the volume's space.</p>

         <p>This section describes the primitive data types used on
         an HFS Plus volume. All data structures in this volume are
         defined in the C language. The specification assumes that
         the compiler will not insert any padding fields. Any
         necessary padding fields are explicitly declared.</p>

                  the HFS volume format. When defining the new
                  format, it was decided to remove unused fields
                  (primarily legacy MFS fields) and arrange all the
                  remaining fields so that similar fields were
                  grouped together and that all fields had proper
                  alignment (using PowerPC alignment rules).</p>

         Fields</h4>
         
         <p>In many places this specification describes a field, or
         bit within a field, as reserved. This has a definite
         meaning, namely:</p>
         
         <ul>
            <li>When creating a structure with a reserved field, an
            implementation must set the field to zero.</li>
            
            <li>When reading existing structures, an implementation

         <p>Pad fields have exactly the same semantics as a reserved

         <h4>Integer Types</h4>
         
         <p>All integer values are defined by one of the following
         primitive types: <code>UInt8</code>, <code>SInt8</code>,
         <code>UInt16</code>, <code>SInt16</code>,
         <code>UInt32</code>, <code>SInt32</code>,
         <code>UInt64</code>, and <code>SInt64</code>. These
         represent unsigned and signed (2's complement) 8-bit,
         16-bit, 32-bit, and 64-bit numbers.</p>
         
         <p>All multi-byte integer values are stored in big-endian
         format. That is, the bytes are stored in order from most
         significant byte through least significant byte, in
         consecutive bytes, at increasing offset from the start of a
         block.  Bits are numbered from 0 to <i>n</i>-1 (for types
         <code>UInt</code><i>n</i> and <code>SInt</code><i>n</i>),
         with bit 0 being the least significant bit.</p>
         
         <h4><a name="HFSPlusNames"></a>HFS Plus Names</h4>
         
         <p>File and folder names on HFS Plus consist of up to 255
         Unicode characters with a preceding 16-bit length, defined
         by the type <code>HFSUniStr255</code>.</p>

         <p><code>UniChar</code> is a <code>UInt16</code> that
         represents a character as defined in the Unicode character
         set defined by <i> The Unicode Standard, Version 2.0</i>

         <p>HFS Plus stores strings fully decomposed and in canonical
         order. HFS Plus compares strings in a case-insensitive
         fashion. Strings may contain Unicode characters that must
         be ignored by this comparison. For more details on these
         subtleties, see <a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/technotes/tn/tn1150.html#UnicodeSubtleties">Unicode
         Subtleties</a>.</p>
         
         <p>A variant of HFS Plus, called <a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/technotes/tn/tn1150.html#HFSX">HFSX</a>,
         allows volumes whose names are compared in a case-sensitive
         fashion.  The names are fully decomposed and in canonical order,
         but no Unicode characters are ignored during the comparison.</p>
         
         <h4><a name="TextEncodings"></a>Text Encodings</h4>
         
         <p>Traditional Mac OS programming interfaces pass filenames as
         Pascal strings (either as a <code>StringPtr</code> or as a
         <code>Str63</code> embedded in an <code>FSSpec</code>). The
         characters in those strings are not Unicode; the encoding
         varies depending on how the system software was localized
         and what language kits are installed. Identical sequences of
         bytes can represent vastly different Unicode character
         sequences. Similarly, many Unicode characters belong to more
         than one Mac OS text encoding.</p>
         
         <p>HFS Plus includes two features specifically designed to
         help Mac OS handle the conversion between Mac OS-encoded
         Pascal strings and Unicode. The first feature is the
         <code>textEncoding</code> field of the file and folder
         catalog records. This field is defined as a hint to be used
         when converting the record's Unicode name back to a Mac OS-
         encoded Pascal string.</p>
         
         <p>The valid values for the <code>textEncoding</code> field
         are defined in Table 2.</p>

                  Mac OS uses the <code>textEncoding</code> field in
                  the following way. When a file or folder is created
                  or renamed, Mac OS converts the supplied Pascal
                  string to a <code>HFSUniStr255</code>. It stores
                  the source text encoding in the
                  <code>textEncoding</code> field of the catalog
                  record. When Mac OS needs to create a Pascal string
                  for that record, it uses the
                  <code>textEncoding</code> as a hint to the text
                  conversion process. This hint ensures a high-degree
                  of round-trip conversion fidelity, which in turn

         <p>The second use of text encodings in HFS Plus is the
         <code>encodingsBitmap</code> field of the volume header. For
         each encoding used by a catalog node on the volume, the
         corresponding bit in the <code>encodingsBitmap</code> field
         must be set.</p>
         
         <p>It is acceptable for a bit in this bitmap to be set even
         though no names on the volume use that encoding. This means
         that when an implementation deletes or renames an object, it
         does not have to clear the encoding bit if that was the last
         name to use the given encoding.</p>

         <h4><a name="HFSPlusDates"></a>HFS Plus Dates</h4>
         
         <p>HFS Plus stores dates in several data structures,
         including the volume header and catalog records. These dates
         are stored in unsigned 32-bit integers (<code>UInt32</code>)
         containing the number of seconds since midnight, January 1,
         1904, GMT. This is slightly different from HFS, where the
         value represents local time.</p>
         
         <p>The maximum representable date is February 6, 2040 at
         06:28:15 GMT.</p>
         
         <p>The date values do not account for leap seconds. They do
         include a leap day in every year that is evenly divisible by
         four. This is sufficient given that the range of
         representable dates does not contain 1900 or 2100, neither
         of which have leap days.</p>
         
         <p>The implementation is responsible for converting these
         times to the format expected by client software. For
         example, the Mac OS File Manager passes dates in local time;
         the Mac OS HFS Plus implementation converts dates between
         local time and GMT as appropriate.</p>

                  The creation date stored in
                  the Volume Header is NOT stored in GMT; it is
                  stored in local time. The reason for this is that
                  many applications (including backup utilities) use
                  the volume's creation date as a relatively unique
                  identifier. If the date was stored in GMT, and
                  automatically converted to local time by an
                  implementation (like Mac OS), the value would
                  appear to change when the local time zone or
                  daylight savings time settings change (and thus
                  cause some applications to improperly identify the
                  volume). The use of the volume's creation date as a
                  unique identifier outweighs its use as a date. This
                  change was introduced late in the Mac OS 8.1

         for HFS -- contains information about the volume as a whole,
         including the location of other key structures in the volume.

         is stored starting 1024 bytes before the end of the volume. The

         header is intended for use solely by disk repair utilities.

                  <code>kHFSBootVolumeInconsistentBit</code>)
                  deserves an explanation. Macintosh ROMs check the

                  be used as described but
                  <code>kHFSVolumeUnmountedBit</code> should remain

                  This is an optimization that prevents the Mac OS
                  ROM from doing a very slow consistency check when
                  the boot volume is mounted since it only checks
                  <code>kHFSVolumeUnmountedBit</code>, and won't do a

                  where keys less than key #X lie in the subtree

                  <p>HFS and HFS Plus are slightly different; in a

         <p>This section describes the B-tree structure used for the
         catalog, extents overflow, and attributes files. A B-tree is
         stored in file data fork. Each B-tree has a
         <code><a href="tn1150.html">HFSPlusForkData</a></code>
         structure in the volume header that describes the size and
         initial extents of that data fork.</p>

                  <code>HFSPlusForkData</code> in the volume header.
                  However, it's still important that the B-tree is in
                  the data fork because the fork is part of the key

         <p>A B-tree file is divided up into fixed-size <b>nodes</b>,
         each of which contains <b>records</b>, which consist of a
         <b>key</b> and some data. The purpose of the B-tree is to
         efficiently map a key into its corresponding data. To
         achieve this, keys must be ordered, that is, there must be a
         well-defined way to decide whether one key is smaller than,
         equal to, or larger than another key.</p>
         
         <p>The <b>node size</b> (which is expressed in bytes) must
         be power of two, from 512 through 32,768, inclusive. The
         node size of a B-tree is determined when the B-tree is
         created. The logical length of a B-tree file is just the
         number of nodes times the node size.</p>
         
         <p>There are four kinds of nodes.</p>
         
         <ul>
            <li>Each B-tree contains a single <b>header node</b>. The
            header node is always the first node in the B-tree. It
            contains the information needed to find other any other
            node in the tree.</li>
            
            <li><b>Map nodes</b> contain <b>map records</b>, which
            hold any allocation data (a bitmap that describes the
            free nodes in the B-tree) that overflows the map record
            in the header node.</li>
            
            <li><b>Index nodes</b> hold <b>pointer records</b> that
            determine the structure of the B-tree.</li>
            
            <li><b>Leaf nodes</b> hold <b>data records</b> that
            contain the data associated with a given key. The key for
            each data record must be unique.</li>

         <h3>Node Structure</h3>
         
         <p>Nodes are indicated by number. The node's number can be
         calculated by dividing its offset into the file by the node
         size. Each node has the same general structure, consisting
         of three main parts: a node descriptor at the beginning of
         the node, a list of record offsets at the end of the node,
         and a list of records. This structure is depicted in Figure
         2.</p>

         other nodes. The <code>BTNodeDescriptor</code> data type

         offset for the first record in the last two bytes of the
         node, the offset for the second record is in the previous
         two bytes, and so on. Since the first record is always at

         <p>The <code>kind</code> field of the node descriptor
         describes the type of a node, which indicates what kinds of
         records it contains and, therefore, its purpose in the
         B-tree hierarchy. There are four kinds of node types given
         by the following constants:</p>

         <p>It's important to realise that the B-tree node type
         determines the type of records found in the node. Leaf nodes
         always contain data records. Index nodes always contain
         pointer records. Map nodes always contain map records. The
         header node always contains a header record, a reserved
         record, and a map record. The four node types and their
         corresponding records are described in the subsequent
         sections.</p>
         
         <h3><a name="HeaderNode"></a>Header Nodes</h3>
         
         <p>The first node (node 0) in every B-tree file
         is a header node, which contains essential information about
         the entire B-tree file. There are three records in the header
         node. The first record is the B-tree header record. The second
         record is the user data record and is always 128 bytes long.
         The last record is the B-tree map record; it occupies all of
         the remaining space between the user data record and the record
         offsets. The header node is shown in Figure 3.</p>

		recording process.</p>
         
         <h4>Map Record</h4>
         
         <p>The remaining space in the header node is occupied by a
         third record, the <b>map record</b>. It is a bitmap that
         indicates which nodes in the B-tree are used and which are
         free. The bits are interpreted in the same way as the bits
         in the <a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/technotes/tn/tn1150.html#AllocationFile">allocation file</a>.</p>
         
         <p>All tolled, the node descriptor, header record, reserved
         record, and record offsets occupy 256 bytes of the header
         node. So the size of the map record (in bytes) is
         <code>nodeSize</code> minus 256. If there are more nodes in
         the B-tree than can be represented by the map record in the
         header node, map nodes are used to store additional
         allocation data.</p>
         
         <h3>Map Nodes</h3>
         
         <p>If the map record of the header node is not large enough
         to represent all of the nodes in the B-tree, <b>map
         nodes</b> are used to store the remaining allocation data.
         In this case, the <code>fLink</code> field of the header
         node's node descriptor contains the node number of the first
         map node.</p>
         
         <p>A map node consists of the node descriptor and a single
         map record. The map record is a continuation of the map
         record contained in the header node. The size of the map
         record is the size of the node, minus the size of the node
         descriptor (14 bytes), minus the size of two offsets (4
         bytes), minus two bytes of free space. That is, the size of
         the map record is the size of the node minus 20 bytes; this
         keeps the length of the map record an even multiple of 4
         bytes. Note that the start of the map record is <em>not</em>
         aligned to a 4-byte boundary: it starts immediately after
         the node descriptor (at an offset of 14 bytes).</p>
         
         <p>The B-tree uses as many map nodes as needed to provide
         allocation data for all of the nodes in the B-tree. The map
         nodes are chained through the <code>fLink</code> fields of

         <p>The records in index and leaf nodes share a common

         by the <b>key</b> itself, followed by the record data.</p>
         
         <p>The first part of the record, <code>keyLength</code>, is
         either a <code>UInt8</code> or a <code>UInt16</code>,
         depending on the <code>attributes</code> field in the
         B-tree's header record. If the <code>kBTBigKeysMask</code>
         bit is set in <code>attributes</code>, the
         <code>keyLength</code> is a <code>UInt16</code>; otherwise,
         it's a <code>UInt8</code>. The length of the key, as stored
         in this field, does not include the size of the
         <code>keyLength</code> field itself.</p>

        </td></tr></tbody></table></center>
         
         <p>Immediately following the <code>keyLength</code> is the
         key itself. The length of the key is determined by the node
         type and the B-tree attributes. In leaf nodes, the length is
         always determined by <code>keyLength</code>. In index nodes,
         the length depends on the value of the
         <code>kBTVariableIndexKeysMask</code> bit in the B-tree
         attributes in the <a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/technotes/tn/tn1150.html#HeaderRecord">header record</a>.
         If the bit is clear, the key occupies a constant number of
         bytes, determined by the <code>maxKeyLength</code> field of
         the B-tree header record. If the bit is set, the key length
         is determined by the <code>keyLength</code> field of the
         keyed record.</p>
         
         <p>Following the key is the record's data. The format of
         this data depends on the node type, as explained in the next
         two sections. However, the data is always aligned on a
         two-byte boundary and occupies an even number of bytes. To
         meet the first alignment requirement, a pad byte must be
         inserted between the key and the data if the size of the
         <code>keyLength</code> field plus the size of the key is
         odd. To meet the second alignment requirement, a pad byte
         must be added after the data if the data size is odd.</p>

         and a node number, expressed a <code>UInt32</code>. The node
         whose number is in a pointer record is called a <b>child
         node</b> of the index node. An index node has two or more

         <p>The bottom level of a B-tree is occupied exclusively by

         that key. The data may be of variable length.</p>
         
         <p>In an HFS Plus B-tree, the data in the data record is the

         <h3><a name="SearchingForKeyedRecords"></a>Searching for
         Keyed Records</h3>
         
         <p>A B-tree is highly structured to allow for efficient
         searching, insertion, and removal. This structure primarily
         affects the keyed records (pointer records and data records)
         and the nodes in which they are stored (index nodes and leaf
         nodes). The following are the ordering requirements for
         index and leaf nodes:</p>
         
         <ul>
            <li>Keyed records must be placed in a node such that
            their keys are in ascending order.</li>
            
            <li>All the nodes in a given level (whose
            <code>height</code> field is the same) must be chained
            via their <code>fLink</code> and <code>bLink</code>
            field. The node with the smallest keys must be first in
            the chain and its <code>bLink</code> field must be zero.
            The node with the largest keys must be last in the chain
            and its <code>fLink</code> field must be zero.</li>
            
            <li>For any given node, all the keys in the node must be
            less than all the keys in the next node in the chain
            (pointed to by <code>fLink</code>). Similarly, all the
            keys in the node must be greater than all the keys in the
            previous node in the chain (pointed to by
            <code>bLink</code>).</li>
         </ul>
         
         <p>Keeping the keys ordered in this way makes it possible to
         quickly search the B-tree to find the data associated with a
         given key. Figure 4 shows a sample B-tree containing
         hypothetical keys (in this case, the keys are simply
         integers).</p>
         
         <p>When an implementation needs to find the data associated
         with a particular <b>search key</b>, it begins searching at
         the root node. Starting with the first record, it searches
         for the record with the greatest key that is less than or
         equal to the search key. In then moves to the child node
         (typically an index node) and repeats the same process.</p>
         
         <p>This process continues until a leaf node is reached. If
         the key found in the leaf node is equal to the search key,
         the found record contains the desired data associated with
         the search key. If the found key is not equal to the search
         key, the search key is not present in the B-tree.</p>

         <h3>HFS and HFS Plus B-Trees Compared</h3>
         
         <p>The structure of the B-trees on an HFS Plus volume is a
         closely related to the
         <a href="http://developer.apple.com/techpubs/mac/Files/Files-104.html">B-tree
         structure used on an HFS volume</a>. There are three
         principal differences: the size of nodes, the size of keys
         within index nodes, and the size of a key length (UInt8 vs.
         UInt16).</p>
         
         <h4><a name="NodeSizes"></a>Node Sizes</h4>
         
         <p>In an HFS B-tree, nodes always have a fixed size of 512
         bytes.</p>
         
         <p>In an HFS Plus B-tree, the node size is determined by a
         field (<code>nodeSize</code>) in the header node. The node
         size must be a power from 512 through 32,768. An
         implementation must use the <code>nodeSize</code> field to
         determine the actual node size.</p>

                  The header node is always located at the start of
                  the B-tree, so you can find it without knowing the
                  B-tree node size.</p>
         </td></tr></tbody></table></center>
         
         <p>HFS Plus uses the following default node sizes:</p>
         
         <ul>
            <li>4 KB (8KB in Mac OS X) for the catalog file</li>
            <li>1 KB (4KB in Mac OS X) for the extents overflow file</li>
            <li>4 KB for the attributes file</li>
         </ul>
         
         <p>These sizes are set when the volume is initialized and
         cannot be easily changed. It is legal to initialize an HFS
         Plus volume with different node sizes, but the node sizes
         must be large enough for an index node to contain two keys
         of maximum size (plus the other overhead such as a node
         descriptor, record offsets, and pointers to children).</p>

         <h4>Key Size in an Index Node</h4>
         
         <p>In an HFS B-tree, all of the keys in an index node occupy
         a fixed amount of space: the maximum key length for that
         B-tree. This simplifies the algorithms for inserting and
         deleting records because, within an index node, one key can
         be replaced by another key without worrying whether there is
         adequate room for the new key. However, it is also somewhat
         wasteful when the keys are variable length (such as in the
         catalog file, where the key length varies with the length of
         the file name).</p>
         
         <p>In an HFS Plus B-tree, the keys in an index node are
         allowed to vary in size. This complicates the algorithms for
         inserting and deleting records, but reduces wasted space
         when the length of a key can vary (such as in the catalog
         file). It also means that the number of keys in an index
         node will vary with the actual size of the keys.</p><br>

         <h2><a name="CatalogFile"></a>Catalog File</h2>
         
         <p>HFS Plus uses a catalog file to maintain information
         about the hierarchy of files and folders on a volume. A
         catalog file is organized as a <a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/technotes/tn/tn1150.html#BTrees">B-tree</a>
         file, and hence consists of a header node, index nodes, leaf
         nodes, and (if necessary) map nodes. The location of the
         first extent of the catalog file (and hence of the file's
         header node) is stored in the volume header. From the
         catalog file's header node, an implementation can obtain the
         node number of the root node of the B-tree. From the root
         node, an implementation can search the B-tree for keys, as
         described in the
         <a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/technotes/tn/tn1150.html#SearchingForKeyedRecords">previous section</a>.
         </p>
         
         <p>The B-Trees chapter defined a standard rule for the
         <a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/technotes/tn/tn1150.html#NodeSizes">node size of HFS Plus B-trees</a>. As
         the catalog file is a B-tree, it inherits the requirements
         of this rule. In addition, the node size of the catalog file
         must be at least 4 KB
         (<code>kHFSPlusCatalogMinNodeSize</code>).</p>
         
         <p><a name="CNID"></a>Each file or folder in the catalog file is assigned a
         unique catalog node ID (CNID). For folders, the CNID is the
         <b>folder ID</b>, sometimes called a directory ID, or dirID;
         for files, it's the <b>file ID</b>. For any given file or
         folder, the parent ID is the CNID of the folder containing
         the file or folder, known as the parent folder.</p>
         
         <p>The catalog node ID is defined by the
         <code>CatalogNodeID</code> data type.</p>

         <p>Typically, CNIDs are allocated sequentially, starting at
         <code>kHFSFirstUserCatalogNodeID</code>.  Versions of the HFS
         Plus specification prior to Jan. 18, 2000, required the
         <code>nextCatalogID</code> field of the <a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/technotes/tn/tn1150.html#VolumeHeader">volume header</a> to be greater than the
         largest CNID used on the volume (so that an implementation
         could use <code>nextCatalogID</code> to determine the CNID to
         assign to a newly created file or directory).  However, this
         can be a problem for volumes that create files or directories
         at a high rate (for example, a busy server), since they might
         run out of CNID values.</p>

         <p>HFS Plus volumes now allow CNID values to wrap around and be
         reused.  The <code>kHFSCatalogNodeIDsReusedBit</code> in the
         <code>attributes</code> field of the <a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/technotes/tn/tn1150.html#VolumeHeader">
         volume header</a> is set to indicate when CNID values have
         wrapped around and been reused.  When
         <code>kHFSCatalogNodeIDsReusedBit</code> is set, the
         <code>nextCatalogID</code> field is no longer required to be
         greater than any existing CNID.</p>

         <p>When <code>kHFSCatalogNodeIDsReusedBit</code> is set,
         <code>nextCatalogID</code> may still be used as a hint for the
         CNID to assign to newly created files or directories, but the
         implementation must verify that CNID is not currently in use
         (and pick another value if it is in use). When CNID number
         <code>nextCatalogID</code> is already in use, an implementation

         <h3>Catalog File Data</h3>
         
         <p>A catalog file leaf node can contain four different types
         of data records:</p>
         
         <ol>
            <li>A <b>folder record</b> contains information about a
            single folder.</li>
            
            <li>A <b>file record</b> contains information about a
            single file.</li>
            
            <li>A <b>folder thread record</b> provides a link between
            a folder and its parent folder, and lets you find a
            folder record given just the folder ID.</li>
            
            <li>A <b>file thread record</b> provides a link between a
            file and its parent folder, and lets you find a file
            record given just the file ID. (In both the folder thread
            and the file thread record, the thread record is used to
            map the file or folder ID to the actual parent directory
            ID and name.)</li>
         </ol>
         
         <p>Each record starts with a <code>recordType</code> field,
         which describes the type of catalog data record. The
         <code>recordType</code> field contains one of the following
         values:</p>

                  The position of the <code>recordType</code> field,
                  and the constants chosen for the various record
                  types, are especially useful if you're writing

                  <p>In HFS, the record type field is one byte, but
                  it's always followed by a one-byte reserved field
                  whose value is always zero. In HFS Plus, the record
                  type field is two bytes. You can use the HFS Plus
                  two-byte record type to examine an HFS record if
                  you use the appropriate constants, as shown below.

                  The traditional Mac OS File Manager programming
                  interfaces require folders to have a valence less
                  than 32,767. An implementation must enforce this
                  restriction if it wants the volume to be usable by
                  Mac OS. Values of 32,768 and larger are
                  problematic; 32,767 and smaller are OK. It's an
                  implementation restriction for the older Mac OS
                  APIs; items 32,768 and beyond would be unreachable

                  matter, many programs are likely to fails with
                  anywhere near that many items in a single folder.
                  So, the volume format allows more than 32,767 items

         <p>The key for a thread record is the file's or folder's <a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/technotes/tn/tn1150.html#CNID">CNID</a> (not the CNID of the parent folder) and
         an empty (zero length) <code>nodeName</code>. This allows a
         file or folder to by found using just the CNID. The thread
         record contains the <code>parentID</code> and
         <code>nodeName</code> field of the file or folder itself.</p>
         
         <p>Finding a file or folder by its CNID is a two-step
         process. The first step is to use the CNID to look up the
         thread record for the file or folder. This yields the file
         or folder's parent folder ID and name. The second step is to
         use that information to look up the real file or folder
         record.</p>
         
         <p>Since files do not contain other files or folders, there
         are no catalog records whose key has a <code>parentID</code>
         equal to a file's CNID and <code>nodeName</code> with
         non-zero length. These unused key values are reserved.</p>

         <p>HFS Plus tracks which allocation blocks belong to a
         file's forks by maintaining a list of extents (contiguous
         allocation blocks) that belong to that file, in the
         appropriate order. Each extent is represented by a pair of
         numbers: the first allocation block number of the extent and
         the number of allocation blocks in the extent. The file
         record in the catalog B-tree contains a record of the first
         eight extents of each fork. If there are more than eight

                  record</a>. So the number of extent records for a

         <h3><a name="ExtentsOverflowFileUsage"></a>Extents Overflow
         File Usage</h3>
         
         <p>The most important thing to remember about extents
         overflow file is that it is only used for forks with more
         than eight extents. In most cases, forks have fewer extents,
         and all the extents information for the fork is held in its
         catalog file record. However, for more fragmented forks, the
         extra extents information is stored in the extents overflow
         file.</p>
         
         <p>When an implementation needs to map a fork offset into a
         position on disk, it first looks through the extent records in
         the catalog file record. If the fork offset is within one
         these extents, the implementation can find the corresponding
         position without consulting the extents overflow file.</p>
         
         <p>If, on the other hand, the fork offset is beyond the last
         extent recorded in the catalog file record, the
         implementation must look in the next extent record, which is
         stored in the extents overflow file. To find this record,
         the implementation must form a key, which consists of
         information about the fork (the fork type and the file ID)
         and the offset info the fork (the start block).</p>
         
         <p>Because extent records are partially keyed off the fork
         offset of the first extent in the record, the implementation
         must have all the preceding extent records in order to know
         the fork offset to form the key of the next extent record.
         For example, if the fork has two extent records in the
         extents overflow file, the implementation must read the
         first extent record to calculate the fork offset for the key
         for the second extent record.</p>
         
         <p>However, you can use the <code>startBlock</code> in the
         extent key to go directly to the record you need. Here's a
         complicated example:</p>
         
         <p>We've got a fork with a total of 23 extents (very
         fragmented!). The <code>blockCounts</code> for the extents,
         in order, are as follows: one extent of 6 allocation blocks,
         14 extents of one allocation block each, two extents of two
         allocation blocks each, one extent of 7 allocation blocks,
         and five more extents of one allocation block each. The fork
         contains a total of 36 allocation blocks.</p>
         
         <p>The block counts for the catalog's fork data are: 6, 1,
         1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1. There is an extent overflow record whose
         startBlock is 13 (0+6+1+1+1+1+1+1+1), and has the following
         block counts: 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2. There is a second
         extent overflow record whose <code>startBlock</code> is 22
         (13+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+2), and has the following block counts: 2,
         7, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0. Note this last record only contains
         seven extents.</p>
         
         <p>Suppose the allocation block size for the volume is 4K.
         Suppose we want to start reading from the file at an offset
         of 108K. We want to know where the data is on the volume,
         and how much contiguous data is there.</p>
         
         <p>First, we divide 108K (the fork offset) by 4K (the
         allocation block size) to get 27, which is the number of
         allocation blocks from the start of the fork. So, we want to
         know where fork allocation block #27 is. We notice that 27
         is greater than or equal to 13 (the number of allocation
         blocks in the catalog's fork data), so we're going to have
         to look in the extents B-tree.</p>
         
         <p>We construct a search key with the appropriate
         <code>fileID</code> and <code>forkType</code>, and set
         <code>startBlock</code> to 27 (the desired fork allocation
         block number). We then search the extents B-tree for the
         record whose key is less than or equal to our search key. We
         find the second extent overflow record (the one with
         <code>startBlock</code>=22). It has the same
         <code>fileID</code> and <code>forkType</code>, so things are
         good. Now we just need to figure out which extent within
         that record to use.</p>
         
         <p>We compute 27 (the desired fork allocation block) minus
         22 (the <code>startBlock</code>) and get 5. So, we want the
         extent that is 5 allocation blocks "into" the record. We try
         the first extent. It's only two allocation blocks long, so
         the desired extent is 3 allocation blocks after that first
         extent in the record. The next extent is 7 allocation blocks
         long. Since 7 is greater than 3, we know the desired fork
         position is within this extent (the second extent in the
         second overflow record). Further, we know that there are
         7-3=4 contiguous allocation blocks (i.e., 16K).</p>
         
         <p>We grab the <code>startBlock</code> for that second
         extent (i.e., the one whose <code>blockCount</code> is 7);
         suppose this number is 444. We add 3 (since the desired
         position was 3 allocation blocks into the extent we found).
         So, the desired position is in allocation block 444+3=447 on
         the volume. That is 447*4K=1788K from the start of the HFS
         Plus volume. (Since the Volume Header always starts 1K after
         the start of the HFS Plus volume, the desired fork position
         is 1787K after the start of the Volume Header.)</p>
         
         <h3><a name="BadBlockFile"></a>Bad Block File</h3>
         
         <p>The extent overflow file is also used to hold information
         about the bad block file. The bad block file is used to mark
         areas on the disk as bad, unable to be used for storing
         data. This is typically used to map out bad sectors on the
         disk.</p>
         

<center><table border="0" width="550">
<tbody><tr><td bgcolor="#E6E6E6">
<p><b>Note:</b><br>                  
                  All space on an HFS Plus volume is allocated in
                  terms of allocation blocks. Typically, allocation
                  blocks are larger than sectors. If a sector is
                  found to be bad, the entire allocation block is
                  unusable.</p>
         </td></tr></tbody></table></center>
         
         <p>When an HFS Plus volume is embedded within an HFS wrapper
         (the way Mac OS normally initializes a hard disk), the space
         used by the HFS Plus volume is marked as part of the bad
         block file <em>within the HFS wrapper itself</em>. (This
         sounds confusing because you have a volume within another
         volume.)</p>
         
         <p>The bad block file is not a file in the same sense as a
         user file (it doesn't have a file record in the catalog) or
         one of the special files (it's not referenced by the volume
         header). Instead, the bad block file uses a special
         <a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/technotes/tn/tn1150.html#CNID">CNID</a>
         (<code>kHFSBadBlockFileID</code>) as the key for extent

         as bad, an extent with this CNID and encompassing the bad
         block is added to the extents overflow file. The block is
         marked as used in the <a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/technotes/tn/tn1150.html#AllocationFile">allocation
         file</a>. These steps prevent the block from being used for

         <a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/technotes/tn/tn1150.html#HFSWrapper">HFS Wrapper</a> to hold an entire HFS
         Plus volume as bad blocks on an HFS disk.</p>

         <p>HFS Plus uses an allocation file to keep track of whether
         each allocation block in a volume is currently allocated to
         some file system structure or not. The contents of the
         allocation file is a bitmap. The bitmap contains one bit for
         each allocation block in the volume. If a bit is set, the
         corresponding allocation block is currently in use by some
         file system structure. If a bit is clear, the corresponding
         allocation block is not currently in use, and is available
         for allocation.</p>

<p><b>Note:</b><br>                  
                  HFS stores allocation information in a special area
                  on the volume, known as the <b>volume bitmap</b>.
                  The allocation file mechanism used by HFS Plus has
                  a number of advantages.</p>
                  
                  <ul>
                     <li>Using a file allows the bitmap itself to be
                     allocated from allocation blocks. This
                     simplifies the design, since volumes are now
                     comprised of only one type of block -- the
                     allocation block. The HFS is slightly more
                     complex because it uses 512-byte blocks to hold the
                     allocation bitmap and allocation blocks to hold
                     file data.</li>
                     
                     <li>The allocation file does not have to be
                     contiguous, which allows allocation information
                     and user data to be interleaved. Many modern
                     file systems do this to reduce head travel when
                     growing files.</li>
                     
                     <li>The allocation file can be extended, which
                     makes it significantly easier to increase the
                     number of allocation blocks on a disk. This is
                     useful if you want to either decrease the
                     allocation block size on a disk, or increase the
                     total disk size.</li>
                     
                     <li>The allocation file may be shrunk. This
                     makes it easy to create a disk images suitable
                     for volumes of varying sizes. The allocation
                     file in the disk image is sized to hold enough
                     allocation data for the largest disk, and shrunk
                     back when the disk is written to a smaller disk.</li>

         <p>Each byte in the allocation file holds the state of eight
         allocation blocks. The byte at offset X into the file
         contains the allocation state of allocations blocks (X * 8)
         through (X * 8 + 7). Within each byte, the most significant
         bit holds information about the allocation block with the
         lowest number, the least significant bit holds information
         about the allocation block with the highest number. Listing
         1 shows how you would test whether an allocation block is in
         use, assuming that you've read the entire allocation file
         into memory.</p>

         <p>The size of the allocation file depends on the number of
         allocation blocks in the volume, which in turn depends both
         on the size of the disk and on the size of the
         volume's allocation blocks. For example, a volume on a 1 GB disk and
         having an allocation block size of 4 KB needs an allocation
         file size of 256 Kbits (32 KB, or 8 allocation blocks).
         Since the allocation file itself is allocated using
         allocation blocks, it always occupies an integral number of
         allocation blocks (its size may be rounded up).</p>
         
         <p>The allocation file may be larger than the minimum number
         of bits required for the given volume size. Any unused bits

                  can be up to 512 MB in size, a radical increase

                  first 1024 bytes and the last 512 bytes) must be
                  marked as allocated in the allocation file. The
                  actual number of allocation blocks allocated for
                  these areas varies with the size of the
                  allocation blocks. Any allocation block that

                  <p>For example, if 512-byte allocation blocks are
                  used, the first three and last two allocation
                  blocks are allocated. With 1024-byte allocation
                  blocks, the first two and the last allocation
                  blocks are allocated. For larger allocation block

         <p>The HFS Plus attributes file is reserved for implementing
         named forks in the future. An attributes file is organized
         as a <a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/technotes/tn/tn1150.html#BTrees">B-tree</a> file. It a special file,

         record types, which makes it roughly as complex as the
         catalog file.</p>
         
         <p>It is possible for a volume to have no attributes file.

         <h2><a name="HardLinks"></a>Hard Links</h2>
         
         <p><b>Hard links</b> are a feature that allows multiple directory entries
         to refer to a single file's content.  They are a way to give a single
         file multiple names, possibly in multiple directories.  This section
         describes how Mac OS X implements hard links on HFS Plus volumes.</p>
         
         <p>The Mac OS X implementation of hard links on HFS Plus volumes
         was done using the existing metadata fields of the catalog records.
         This makes it possible to back up and restore a volume using hard
         links, by backing up and restoring individual files, without having
         to understand or interpret the hard links.  An HFS Plus implementation
         may choose to automatically follow hard links, or not.</p>
         
         <p>Hard links in HFS Plus are represented by a set of several files.
         The actual file content (which is shared by each of the hard links)
         is stored in a special <b>indirect node file</b>.  This indirect node file
         is the equivalent of an inode in a traditional UNIX file system.</p>
         
         <p>HFS Plus uses special <b>hard link files</b> (or <b>links</b>)
         to refer (or point) to an indirect node file.  There is one hard link
         file for each directory entry or name that refers to the file content.</p>
         
         <p>Indirect node files exist in a special directory called the
         <b>metadata directory</b>.  This directory exists in the volume's root
         directory.  The name of the metadata directory is four null
         characters followed by the string "HFS+ Private Data".  The
         directory's creation date is set to the creation date of the
         volume's root directory. The <code>kIsInvisible</code> and
         <code>kNameLocked</code> bits are set in the directory's
         <a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/technotes/tn/tn1150.html#FinderInfo">Finder information</a>.  The icon
         <code>location</code> in the Finder info is set to the point
         (22460, 22460). These Finder info settings are not mandatory,
         but they tend to reduce accidental changes to the metadata directory.
         An implementation that automatically follows hard links should
         make the metadata directory inaccessable from its normal
         file system interface.</p>

         <a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/technotes/tn/tn1150.html#HFSX">HFSX</a> sorts null characters after all other
         characters, so the metadata directory will typically be the last
         item in the root directory.  On case-sensitive <a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/technotes/tn/tn1150.html#HFSX">HFSX</a>
         volumes, null characters sort before other characters, so the

         <p>Indirect node files have a special identifying number called a
         <b>link reference</b>.  The link reference is unique among indirect
         node files on a given volume.  The link reference is not related to
         <a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/technotes/tn/tn1150.html#CNID">catalog node IDs</a>.  When a new indirect node
         file is created, it is assigned a new link reference randomly chosen
         from the range 100 to 1073741923.</p>
         
         <p>The file name of an indirect node file is the string "iNode"
         immediately followed by the link reference converted to decimal text,
         with no leading zeroes.  For example, an indirect node file with link
         reference 123 would have the name "iNode123".</p>
         
         <p>An indirect node file <b>must</b> be a file, not a directory.
         Hard links to directories are not allowed because they could cause cycles
         in the directory hierarchy if a hard link pointed to one of its ancestor
         directories.</p>

		<p>The <code>linkCount</code> field in the
		<a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/technotes/tn/tn1150.html#HFSPlusPermissions">permissions</a> is an estimate of
		the number of links referring to this indirect node file.  An
		implementation that understands hard links should increment this
		value when creating an additional link, and decrement the value
		when removing a link. However, some implementations (such as
		traditional Mac OS) do not understand hard links and may make
		changes that cause the <code>linkCount</code> to be inaccurate.
		Similarly, it is possible for a link to refer to an indirect
		node file that does not exist.  When removing a link, an
		implementation should not allow the <code>linkCount</code>
		to underflow; if it is already zero, do not change it.</p>

         <p><a name="UnlinkedFiles"></a>POSIX semantics allow an open file to
         be unlinked (deleted).  These open but unlinked files are stored on HFS
         Plus volumes much like a hard link.  When the open file is deleted, it
         is renamed and moved into the metadata directory.  The new name is the
         string "temp" followed by the <a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/technotes/tn/tn1150.html#CNID">catalog node ID</a>
         converted to decimal text. When the file is eventually closed, this
         temporary file may be removed.  All such temporary files may be removed
         when repairing an unmounted HFS Plus volume.</p>
         
         <h3>Repairing the Metadata Directory</h3>
         <p>When repairing an HFS Plus volume with hard links or a metadata
         directory, there are several conditions that might need to be repaired:</p>
         <ul>
         	<li>Opened but deleted files (which are now orphaned).</li>
         	<li>Orphaned indirect node files (no hard links refer to them).</li>
         	<li>Broken hard link (hard link exists, but indirect node file does not).</li>
         	<li>Incorrect link count.</li>
         	<li>Link reference was 0.</li>
         </ul>
         
         <p>Opened but deleted files are files whose names start with "temp",
         and are in the metadata directory.  If the volume is not in use
         (not mounted, and not being used by any other utility), then these
         files can be deleted.  Volumes with a <a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/technotes/tn/tn1150.html#Journal">journal</a>,
         even one with no active transactions, may have opened but undeleted
         files that need to be deleted.</p>
         
         <p>Detecting an orphaned indirect node file, broken hard link, or incorrect link
         count requires finding all hard link files in the catalog, and comparing
         the number of found hard links for each link reference with the link
         count of the corresponding indirect node file.</p>
         
         <p>A hard link with a link reference equal to 0 is invalid. Such a hard
         link may be the result of a hard link being copied or restored by an
         implementation or utility that does not use the <a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/technotes/tn/tn1150.html#HFSPlusPermissions">
         permissions</a> in catalog records.  It may be possible to repair the
         hard link by determining the proper link reference.  Otherwise, the
         hard link should be deleted.</p>

         a special kind of file that refers to another file or directory.
         A symbolic link stores the path name of the file or directory it
         refers to.</p>
         
         <p>On an HFS Plus volume, a symbolic link is stored
         as an ordinary file with special values in some of the fields of its
         <a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/technotes/tn/tn1150.html#CatalogFileRecord">catalog record</a>.  The pathname of the
         file being referred to is stored in the data fork. The file type in

         permissions</a> is set to <code>S_IFLNK</code>. For compatibility

		<h2><a name="Journal"></a>Journal</h2>
		
		<p>An HFS Plus volume may have an optional <b>journal</b> to speed
		recovery when mounting a volume that was not unmounted safely
		(for example, as the result of a power outage or crash). The
		journal makes it quick and easy to restore the volume
		structures to a consistent state, without having to scan all of
		the structures. The journal is used only for the volume
		structures and metadata; it does not protect the contents of a
		fork.</p>
		
		<h3>Background</h3>
		
		<p>A single change to the volume may require writing coordinated
		changes to many different places on the volume.  If a failure
		happens after some, but not all, of the changes have been
		written, then the volume may be seriously damaged and may result
		in catastrophic loss of data.</p>

		<p>For example, creating a file or directory requires adding two
		records (the file or folder record, and its thread record) to the
		catalog B-tree.  A leaf node may not have enough room for a new
		record, so it may have to be split.  That means that some records
		will be removed from the existing node and put into a newly
		allocated node.  This requires adding a new key and pointer to
		the index node that is the parent of the leaf being split (which
		might require splitting the index node, and so on).  If a failure
		occurs after the split, but before the index node is updated,
		all of the items in the new node would become inaccessible.
		Recovery from this sort of damage is time consuming at best,
		and may be impossible.</p>

		<p>The purpose of the journal is to ensure that when a group of
		related changes are being made, that either all of those changes
		are actually made, or none of them are made.  This is done by
		gathering up all of the changes, and storing them in a separate
		place (in the journal).  Once the journal copy of the changes
		is completely written to disk, the changes can actually be
		written to their normal locations on disk.  If a failure happens
		at that time, the changes can simply be copied from the
		journal to their normal locations.  If a failure happens when
		the changes are being written to the journal, but before they are
		marked complete, then all of those changes are ignored.</p>

		<p>A group of related changes is called a <b>transaction</b>. 
		When all of the changes of a transaction have been written to
		their normal locations on disk, that transaction has been
		<b>committed</b>, and is removed from the journal.  The journal
		may contain several transactions.  Copying changes from all
		transactions to their normal locations on disk is called
		<b>replaying</b> the journal.</p>

<center><table border="0" width="550">
<tbody><tr><td bgcolor="#E6E6E6">
<p><b>IMPORTANT:</b><br>         
		Implementations accessing a journaled volume with transactions
		must either refuse to access the volume, or replay the journal
		to be sure the volume is consistent.  If the
		<code>lastModifiedVersion</code> field of the
		<a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/technotes/tn/tn1150.html#VolumeHeader">volume header</a> does not match the
		signature of an implementation known to properly use and update
		the journal, then the journal must not be replayed (since it may
		no longer match the on-disk structures, and could cause
		corruption if replayed).</p>

		<h3>Overview of Journal Data Structures</h3>

		<p>If <code>kHFSVolumeJournaledBit</code> is set in the <a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/technotes/tn/tn1150.html#VolumeHeader">volume header's</a> <code>attributes</code> field, the
		volume has a journal.  The journal data stuctures consist of a
		journal info block, journal header, and journal buffer.  The
		<b>journal info block</b> indicates the location and size of the
		journal header and journal buffer.  The <b>journal buffer</b> is
		the space set aside to hold transactions.  The <b>journal
		header</b> describes which part of the journal buffer is active
		and contains transactions waiting to be committed.</p>

<center><img src="tn1150_007.png" alt="Overview of an HFS Plus Journal" width="441" height="504" align="bottom">
<p><b>Figure 7</b>. Overview of an HFS Plus Journal.</p>
</center>

		<p>On HFS Plus volumes, the journal info block is stored as a
		file (so that its space can be properly represented in a catalog
		record and the allocation bitmap).  The name of that file is
		<code>".journal_info_block"</code> and it is stored in the
		volume's root directory.  The journal header and journal buffer
		are stored together in a different file named
		<code>".journal"</code>, also in the volume's root directory. 
		Each of these files are contiguous on disk (they occupy exactly
		one extent).  An implementation that uses the journal must
		prevent the files from being accessed as normal files.</p>

<center><table border="0" width="550">
<tbody><tr><td bgcolor="#E6E6E6">
<p><b>Note:</b><br>         
		An implementation must find the journal info block by using the
		<code>journalInfoBlock</code> field of the volume header, not by
		the file name.  Similarly, an implementation must find the
		journal header and journal buffer using the contents of the
		journal info block, not the file name.</p>
</td></tr></tbody></table></center>

		<p>A single transaction consists of several blocks, including
		both the data to be written, and the location where that data is
		to be written.  This is represented on disk by a <b>block list
		header</b>, which describes the number and sizes of the blocks,
		immediately followed by the contents of those blocks.</p>
		
<center><img src="tn1150_008.png" alt="A Simple Transaction" width="288" height="360" align="bottom">
<p><b>Figure 8</b>. A Simple Transaction.</p>
</center>

		<p>Since block list headers are of limited size, a single
		transaction may consist of several block list headers and their
		associated block contents (one block list header followed by the
		contents of the blocks that header describes, then the next
		block list header and its block contents, and so on).  If the
		<code>next</code> field of the first <code>block_info</code> is
		non-zero, then the next block list header is a continuation of
		the same transaction.</p>

<center><img src="tn1150_009.png" alt="A Transaction with Multiple Block Lists" width="288" height="657">
<p><b>Figure 9</b>. A Transaction with Multiple Block Lists.</p>
</center>

		<p>The journal buffer is treated as a circular buffer. When
		reading or writing the journal buffer, the I/O operation must
		stop at the end of the journal buffer and resume (wrap around)
		immediately following the journal header.  Block list headers or
		the contents of blocks may wrap around in this way.  Only a
		portion of the journal buffer is active at any given time; this
		portion is indicated by the <code>start</code> and
		<code>end</code> fields of the journal header.  The part of the
		journal buffer that is not active contains no meaningful data,
		and must be ignored.</p>
         
		<p>To prevent ambiguity when <code>start</code> equals
		<code>end</code>, the journal is never allowed to be perfectly
		full (all of the journal buffer used by block lists and blocks).
		If the journal was perfectly full, and <code>start</code> was
		not equal to <code>jhdr_size</code>, then <code>end</code> would
		be equal to <code>start</code>.  You would then be unable to

		<h3><a name="HFSX_V5"></a>HFSX Version 5</h3>
		
		<p>Introduced in Mac OS X 10.3, HFSX version 5 allows volumes with
		case-sensitive file and directory names.  Case-sensitive names
		means that you can have two objects, whose names differ only by
		the case of the letters, in the same directory at the same time.
		For example, you could have "Bob", "BOB", and "bob" in the same
		directory.</p>
		
		<p>An HFSX volume may be either case-sensitive or case-insensitive.
		Case sensitivity (or lack thereof) is global to the volume; the
		setting applies to all file and directory names on the volume.
		To determine whether an HFSX volume is case-sensitive, use the
		<code>keyCompareType</code> field of the <a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/technotes/tn/tn1150.html#HeaderRecord">
		B-tree header</a> of the <a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/technotes/tn/tn1150.html#CatalogFile">catalog file</a>.
		A value of <code>kHFSBinaryCompare</code> means the volume is
		case-sensitive.  A value of <code>kHFSCaseFolding</code> means the
		volume is case-insensitive.</p>

		different determines the relative order.  The string with the
		numerically smaller character value is ordered before the string
		with the larger character value.  For example, the string "Bob"

		<h2><a name="MetadataZone"></a>Metadata Zone</h2>
		
		<p>Mac OS X version 10.3 introduced a new policy for determining
		where to allocate space for files, which improves performance
		for most users.  This policy places the volume metadata and
		frequently used small files ("<a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/technotes/tn/tn1150.html#HotFile">hot files</a>")
		near each other on disk, which reduces the seek time for typical
		accesses.  This area on disk is known as the <b>metadata
		zone</b>.</p>
		
		<p>The volume metadata are the structures that let the file system
		manage the contents of the volume.  It includes the
		<a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/technotes/tn/tn1150.html#AllocationFile">allocation bitmap file</a>,
		<a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/technotes/tn/tn1150.html#ExtentsOverflowFile">extents overflow file</a>,
		and the <a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/technotes/tn/tn1150.html#CatalogFile">catalog file</a>, and the
		<a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/technotes/tn/tn1150.html#Journal">journal file</a>.  The
		<a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/technotes/tn/tn1150.html#VolumeHeader">volume header</a> and alternate volume
		header are also metadata, but they have fixed locations within
		the volume, so they are not located in the hot file area.  Mac OS
		X may use a quota users file and quota groups file to manage disk
		space quotas on a volume.  These files aren't strictly metadata,
		but they are included in the metadata zone because of their 
		heavy use by the OS and they are too large to be considered
		ordinary hot files.</p>
		
		<p>Implementations are encouraged not to interfere with the metadata
		zone policy.  For example, a disk optimizer should avoid moving files
		into the metadata zone unless that file is known to be
		frequently accessed, in which case it may be added to the "<a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/technotes/tn/tn1150.html#HotFile">hot file</a>" list.  Similarly, files in the
		metadata zone should not be moved elsewhere on disk unless they
		are also removed from the hot file list.</p>
		
		<p>This policy is only applied to volumes whose size is at least
		10GB, and which have <a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/technotes/tn/tn1150.html#Journal">journaling</a> enabled.
		The metadata zone is established when the volume is mounted.  The
		size of the zone is based upon the following sizes:</p>
		
		<table border="1">

		<p>In Mac OS X version 10.3, the amount of space reserved for the
		allocation file is actually the minimum allocation file size for
		the volume (the total number of allocation blocks, divided by 8,
		rounded up to a multiple of the allocation block size).  If the
		allocation file is larger than that (which is sometimes done to
		allow a volume to be more easily grown at a later time), then
		there will be less space available for other metadata or
		<a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/technotes/tn/tn1150.html#HotFile">hot files</a> in the metadata zone.  This
		is a bug (r. 3522516).</p>
		
		<p>The amount of space reserved for each type of metadata (except for
		the allocation bitmap file) is based on the total size of the volume.
		For the purposes of these computations, the total size of the volume is
		the allocation block size multiplied by the total number of allocation blocks.</p>
		
		<p>The sizes reserved for quota users and groups files are the result of
		complex calculations.  In each case, the size reserved is a value of
		the form <code>(items + 1) * 64</code> bytes, where <code>items</code>
		is based on the size of the volume in gigabytes, rounded down.  For the
		quota users file, <code>items</code> is 256 per gigabyte, rounded up to
		a power of 2, with a minimum of 2048, and a maximum of 2097152 (2M).
		For the quota groups file, <code>items</code> is 32 per gigabyte,
		rounded up to a power of 2, with a minimum of 2048, and a maximum of
		262144 (256K).  The quota files are considered hot files, and occupy
		the <a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/technotes/tn/tn1150.html#HotFile">hot file</a> area, even though they are larger
		than the maximum file size normally eligible to be a hot file.</p>
		
		<p>The total size of the metadata zone is the sum of the above sizes,
		rounded up so that the metadata zone is represented by a whole number
		of allocation blocks within the volume bitmap.  That is, the start and
		end of the metadata zone fall on allocation block boundaries in the
		volume bitmap.  That means that the size of the metadata zone is rounded
		up to a multiple of 8 times the square of the allocation block size.
		In Mac OS X version 10.3, the extra space due to the round up of the
		metadata zone is split up between the catalog and the
		<a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/technotes/tn/tn1150.html#HotFile">hot file</a> area (2/3 and 1/3, respectively).</p>
		
		<p>The calculations for the extents overflow file and journal file divide
		the total size of the volume by 100GB, rounding down.  Then they add one
		(to compensate for any remainder lost as part of the rounding).  The result
		is then multiplied by 4MB or 8MB, respectively.  If the volume's total
		size is not a multiple of 100GB, this is equivalent to 4MB (or 8MB) per 100GB,
		rounded up.</p>
				
		<p>In Mac OS X version 10.3, the metadata zone is located at the
		start of the volume, following the
		<a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/technotes/tn/tn1150.html#VolumeHeader">volume header</a>. The
		<a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/technotes/tn/tn1150.html#HotFile">hot file</a> area is located towards the end of
		the metadata zone.</p>
		
		<p>When performing normal file allocations, the allocator will
		skip over the metadata zone.  This ensures that the metadata will be
		less fragmented, and all of the metadata will be located in the
		same area on the disk.  If the area outside the metadata zone is
		exhausted, the allocator will then use space inside the metadata
		zone for normal file allocations.  Similarly, when allocating
		space for metadata, the allocator will use space inside the
		metadata zone first.  If all of the metadata zone is in use,
		then metadata allocations will use space outside the metadata
		zone.</p>
		
		<h2><a name="HotFile"></a>Hot Files</h2>
		
		<p>Most files on a disk are rarely, if ever, accessed.  Most
		frequently accessed (<b>hot</b>) files are small.  To improve
		performance of these small, frequently access files, they are
		moved near the volume's metadata, into the metadata zone.  This
		reduces seek times for most accesses.  As files are moved into
		the metadata zone, they are also defragmented (allocated in a
		single extent), which further improves performance.  This
		process is known as <b>adaptive hot file clustering</b>. </p>
		
		<p><a name="Temperature"></a>The relative importance of a
		frequently used (hot) file is called its <b>temperature</b>. 
		Files with the hottest (largest) temperatures are the ones
		actually moved into the metadata zone. In Mac OS X version 10.3,
		a file's temperature is computed as the number of bytes read
		from the file during the recording period divided by the file's
		size in bytes. This is a measure of how often the file is
		read.</p>

		<p>This section describes the on-disk structures used for
		tracking hot files.  The algorithms used at run time are subject
		to change, and are not documented here.</p>

		<p>Migration of files into or out of the hot file area of the metadata zone is a
		gradual process, based upon the user's actual file access
		patterns. The migration happens in several phases:</p>

		<dl>
		<dt>Recording</dt>
		<dd>Watch file accesses to determine which files are used most</dd>
		
		<dt>Evaluation</dt>
		<dd>Merge recently used hot files with previously found hot files</dd>
		
		<dt>Eviction</dt>
		<dd>Move older and less frequently used hot files out of metadata zone
		to make room for newer, hotter files</dd>

		<dt>Adoption</dt>
		<dd>Move newer and hotter files into the metadata zone</dd>
		</dl>
		
		<h3>Hot File B-Tree</h3>
		
		<p>A <a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/technotes/tn/tn1150.html#BTrees">B-Tree</a> is used to keep track of the
		files that currently occupy the hot file area of the <a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/technotes/tn/tn1150.html#MetadataZone"> metadata zone</a>.  The hot file B-tree is an
		ordinary file on the volume (that is, it has records in the <a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/technotes/tn/tn1150.html#CatalogFile">catalog</a>). It is a file named
		"<code>.hotfiles.btree</code>" in the root directory. To avoid
		accidental manipulation of this file, the
		<code>kIsInvisible</code> and <code>kNameLocked</code> bits in
		the <code>finderFlags</code> field of the <a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/technotes/tn/tn1150.html#FinderInfo">Finder info</a> should be set.</p>
		
		<p>The node size of the hot file B-tree is at least 512 bytes,
		and is typically the same as the the volume's allocation block
		size.  Like other B-trees on an HFS Plus volume, the key length
		field is 16 bits, and <code>kBTBigKeysMask</code> is set in the
		B-tree header's <code>attributes</code>.  The
		<code>btreeType</code> in the <a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/technotes/tn/tn1150.html#HeaderRecord">header
		record</a> must be set to <code>kUserBTreeType</code>.</p>
		
		<p>The B-tree's <a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/technotes/tn/tn1150.html#UserDataRecord">user data record</a>
		contains information about hot file recording.  The format of the user
		data is described by the <code>HotFilesInfo</code> structure:</p>

		<p>Hot file keys are compared first by <code>temperature</code>,
		then <code>fileID</code>, and lastly by <code>forkType</code>. 
		All of these comparisons are unsigned.</p>
		
		<h4>Hot File Records</h4>
		
		<p>Much like the <a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/technotes/tn/tn1150.html#CatalogFile">catalog file</a>,
		the hot file B-tree stores two kinds of records: hot file records and thread
		records.  Every fork in the hot file area has both a hot file record and
		a thread record in the hot file B-tree.  Hot file records are used to find
		hot files based on their temperature.  Thread records are used to find
		hot files based on their <a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/technotes/tn/tn1150.html#CNID">catalog node ID</a> and fork type.</p>
		
		<p>Thread records in the hot file B-tree use a special value
		(<code>HFC_LOOKUPTAG</code>) in the <code>temperature</code>
		field of the key.  The data for a thread record is the
		<code>temperature</code> of that fork, stored as a
		<code>UInt32</code>.  So, given a <a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/technotes/tn/tn1150.html#CNID">catalog node
		ID</a> and fork type, it is possible to construct a key for the
		fork's thread record.  If a thread record exists, you can get
		the temperature from the thread's data to construct the key for
		the hot file record.  If a thread record does not exist, then
		the fork is not being tracked as a hot file.</p>
		
		<p>Hot file records use all of the key fields as described
		above. The data for a hot file record is 4 bytes. The data in a
		hot file record is not meaningful. To aid in debugging, Mac OS X
		version 10.3 typically stores the first four bytes of the file
		name (encoded in UTF-8), or the ASCII text "????".</p>
		
		<p>When an implementation changes a hot file's temperature, the
		old hot file record must be removed, a new hot file with the new
		temperature must be inserted, and the thread record's data must
		be changed to contain the new temperature.</p>
		
		<h3>Recording Hot File Temperatures</h3>
		
		<p>The recording phase gathers information about file usage over time.
		In order to gather useful statistics, the recording phase may last longer
		than the duration of a single mount.  Therefore, information about file
		usage is stored on disk so that it can accumulate over time.</p>
		
		<p>The <code>clumpSize</code> field of the <a href="tn1150.html">
		fork data structure</a> is used to record the amount of data actually
		read from a fork.  Since the field is only 32 bits long, it stores
		the number of allocation blocks read from the file.  The fork's

         <p>HFS Plus makes heavy use of Unicode strings to store file
         and folder names. However, Unicode is still evolving, and
         its use within a file system presents a number of
         challenges. This section describes some of the challenges,
         along with the solutions used by HFS Plus.</p>

         An implementation must not use the Unicode utilities
         implemented by its native platform (for decomposition and
         comparison), unless those algorithms are equivalent to the
         HFS Plus algorithms defined here, and are guaranteed to be
         so forever. This is rarely the case. Platform algorithms
         tend to evolve with the Unicode standard. The HFS Plus

         The Mac OS Text Encoding Converter provides several
         constants that let you convert to and from the canonical,
         decomposed form stored on HFS Plus volumes. When using
         <code>CreateTextEncoding</code> to create a text encoding,
         you should set the <code>TextEncodingBase</code> to
         <code>kTextEncodingUnicodeV2_0</code>, set the
         <code>TextEncodingVariant</code> to
         <code>kUnicodeCanonicalDecompVariant</code>, and set the

         <code>kUnicode16BitFormat</code>. Using these values ensures
         that the Unicode will be in the same form as on an HFS Plus

<h3><a name="CanonicalDecomposition"></a>Canonical Decomposition</h3>

         <p>Unicode allows some sequences of characters to be
         represented by multiple, equivalent forms. For example, the
         character "<img src="tn1150_005.gif" width="7" height="11" align="bottom" alt="1150.5.gif">"
         can be represented as the single Unicode character
         u+00E9 (latin small letter e with acute), or as
         the two Unicode characters u+0065 and u+0301 (the letter "e"
         plus a combining acute symbol).</p>
         
         <p>To reduce complexity in the B-tree key comparison
         routines (which have to compare Unicode strings), HFS Plus
         defines that Unicode strings will be stored in fully
         decomposed form, with composing characters stored in
         canonical order. The other equivalent forms are illegal in
         HFS Plus strings. An implementation must convert these
         equivalent forms to the fully decomposed form before storing
         the string on disk.</p>
         
         <p>The <a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/technotes/tn/tn1150table.html">Unicode Decomposition</a>
         table contains a list of characters that are illegal as part
         of an HFS Plus string, and the equivalent character(s) that
         must be used instead. Any character appearing in a column
         titled "Illegal", must be replaced by the character(s) in
         the column immediately to the right (titled "Replace With").

         based on Unicode 3.2.  Most of the characters whose decomposition

         strings must be compared in a case-insensitive fashion. The
         Unicode standard does not strictly define upper and lower
         case equivalence, although it does suggest some equivalences.
         The HFS Plus string comparison algorithm (defined below)
         include a concrete case equivalence definition. An
         implementation must use the equivalence expressed by this
         algorithm.</p>
         
         <p>Furthermore, Unicode requires that certain formatting
         characters be ignored (skipped over) during string
         comparisons. The algorithm and tables used for case
         equivalence also arrange to ignore these characters. An
         implementations must ignore the characters that are ignored

  str1 &gt; str2     =&gt;  +1

  The lower case table starts with 256 entries (one for
  each of the upper bytes of the original Unicode char).
  If that entry is zero, then all characters with that
  upper byte are already case folded.  If the entry is
  non-zero, then it is the _index_ (not byte offset) of
  the start of the sub-table for the characters with
  that upper byte.  All ignorable characters are folded
  to the value zero.

  In pseudocode:

      Let c = source Unicode character
      Let table[] = lower case table

      lower = table[highbyte(c)]
      if (lower == 0)
          lower = c
      else
          lower = table[lower+lowbyte(c)]

      if (lower == 0)
          ignore this character

  To handle ignorable characters, we now need a loop to
  find the next valid character.  Also, we can't pre-compute
  the number of characters to compare; the string length
  might be larger than the number of non-ignorable characters.
  Further, we must be able to handle ignorable characters at
  any point in the string, including as the first or last
  characters.  We use a zero value as a sentinel to detect
  both end-of-string and ignorable characters.  Since the
  File Manager doesn't prevent the NULL character (value
  zero) as part of a file name, the case mapping table is
  assumed to map u+0000 to some non-zero value (like 0xFFFF,
  which is an invalid Unicode character).

  Pseudocode:

      while (1) {
          c1 = GetNextValidChar(str1) -- returns zero if

         <p>An HFS Plus volume may be contained within an HFS volume
         in a way that makes the volume look like an HFS volume to
         systems without HFS Plus support. This has a two important
         advantages:</p>
         
         <ol>
            <li>It allows a computer with HFS (but no HFS Plus)
            support in ROM to start up from an HFS Plus volume. When
            creating the wrapper, Mac OS includes a System file
            containing the minimum code to locate and mount the
            embedded HFS Plus volume and continue booting from its
            System file.</li>
            
            <li>It improves the user experience when an HFS Plus
            volume is inserted in a computer that has HFS support but
            no HFS Plus support. On such a computer, the HFS wrapper
            will be mounted as a volume, which prevents error dialogs
            that might confuse the user into thinking the volume is
            empty, damaged, or unreadable. The HFS wrapper may also
            contain a Read Me document to explain the steps the user
            should take to access their files.</li>
         </ol>
         
         <p>The rest of this section describes how the HFS wrapper is

         support volumes embedded within an HFS volume, several

         two-byte field contains a unique value that identifies the
         type of embedded volume. When an HFS Plus volume is
         embedded, <code>drEmbedSigWord</code> must be
         <code>kHFSPlusSigWord</code> (<code>'H+'</code>), the same

         where the embedded volume begins and number of allocation
         blocks (<code>blockCount</code> ) the embedded volume
         occupies. The embedded volume must be contiguous. Both of

         <p>In order to prevent accidentally changing the files in
         the HFS wrapper, the wrapper volume must be marked as
         software-write-protected by setting
         <code>kHFSVolumeSoftwareLockBit</code> in the
         <code>drAtrb</code> (volume attributes) field of the MDB.
         All correct HFS implementations will prevent any changes to
         the wrapper volume.</p>
         
         <p>To improve performance of HFS Plus volumes, the size of
         the wrapper's allocation blocks should be a multiple of the
         size of the HFS Plus volume's allocation blocks. In
         addition, the wrapper's allocation block start
         (<code>drAlBlSt</code>) should be a multiple of the HFS Plus
         volume's allocation block size (or perhaps 4 KB, if the HFS
         Plus allocation blocks are larger). If these recommendations
         are followed, the HFS Plus allocation blocks will be
         properly aligned on the disk. And, if the HFS Plus
         allocation block size is a multiple of the sector size,
         then blocking and deblocking at the device driver level
         will be minimized.</p>
         
         <h3>Allocating Space for the Embedded Volume</h3>
         
         <p>The space occupied by the embedded volume must be marked
         as allocated in the HFS wrapper's volume bitmap (similar to
         the HFS Plus <a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/technotes/tn/tn1150.html#AllocationFile">allocation file</a>)
         and placed in the HFS wrapper's bad block file (similar to
         the HFS Plus <a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/technotes/tn/tn1150.html#BadBlockFile">bad block file</a>).
         This doesn't mean the blocks are actually bad; it merely
         prevents the HFS Plus volume from being overwritten by newly
         created files in the HFS wrapper, being deleted
         accidentally, or being marked as free, usable space by HFS
         disk repair utilities.</p>
         
         <p>The <code>kHFSVolumeSparedBlocksMask</code> bit of the
         <code>drAtrb</code> (volume attributes) field of the MDB
         must be set to indicate that the volume has a bad blocks
         file.</p>

<p><b>IMPORTANT:</b><br>
         
         This section is not part of the HFS Plus volume format. It

         creates HFS wrappers. It is provided for your information
         only.</p>
</td></tr></tbody></table></center>

         <p>As initialized by the Mac OS Disk Initialization Package,
         the HFS wrapper volume contains five files in the root
         folder.</p>
         
         <ul>
            <li>Read Me -- The Read Me file, whose name is actually
            "Where_have_all_my_files_gone?", contains text explaining
            that this volume is really an HFS Plus volume but the
            contents cannot be accessed because HFS Plus is not
            currently installed on the computer. It also describes
            the steps needed to install HFS Plus support. Localized
            system software will also create a localized version of
            the file with localized file name and text content.</li>
            
            <li>System and Finder (invisible) -- The System file
            contains the minimum code to locate and mount the
            embedded HFS Plus volume, and to continue booting from
            the System file in the embedded volume. The Finder file
            is empty; it is there to prevent older versions of the
            Finder from de-blessing the wrapper's root directory,
            which would prevent booting from the volume.</li>
            
            <li>Desktop DB and Desktop DF (invisible) -- The Desktop
            DB and Desktop DF files are an artifact of the way the
            files on the wrapper volume are created.</li>
         </ul>
         
         <p>In addition, the root folder is set as the blessed folder
         by placing its folder ID in the first <code>SInt32</code> of
         the <code>drFndrInfo</code> (Finder information) field of
         the MDB.</p>

         <h2><a name="VolumeConsistencyChecks"></a>Volume Consistency Checks</h2>
         
         <p>An HFS Plus volume is a complex data structure,
         consisting of many different inter-related data structures.
         Inconsistencies between these data structures could cause
         serious data loss. When an HFS Plus implementation mounts a
         volume, it must perform basic consistency checks to ensure
         that the volume is consistent. In addition, the
         implementation may choose to implement other, more advanced,
         consistency checks.</p>
         
         <p>Many of these consistency checks take a significant
         amount of time to run. While a safe implementation might run
         these checks every time a volume is mounted, most
         implementations will want to rely on the correctness of the
         previous implementation that modified the disk. The
         implementation may avoid unnecessary checking by determining
         whether the volume was last unmounted cleanly. If it was,
         the implementation may choose to skip a consistency check.
         </p>
         
         <p>An implementation can determine whether a volume was
         unmounted cleanly by looking at various flag bits in the
         volume header. See <a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/technotes/tn/tn1150.html#VolumeAttributes">Volume
         Attributes</a> for details.</p>
         
         <h3><a name="CNIDCheck"></a>Next Catalog Node ID Consistency Check</h3>
         
         <p>For an HFS Plus volume to work correctly with
         many implementations, it is vital that the <code>nextCatalogID</code>
         field of the <a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/technotes/tn/tn1150.html#VolumeHeader">volume header</a> be greater than
         all <a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/technotes/tn/tn1150.html#CNID">CNIDs</a> currently used in the
         catalog file. The algorithm to ensure this is as follows.
         </p>
         
         <ul>
            <li>The implementation must iterate through all the leaf
            nodes of the catalog file, looking for file and folder
            records, determining the maximum CNID of any file or
            folder in the catalog.</li>
            
            <li>Once it knows the maximum CNID value, the
            implementation must set <code>nextCatalogID</code> to a
            value greater than it.</li>
         </ul>

<center><table border="0" width="550">
<tbody><tr><td bgcolor="#E6E6E6">
<p><b>Note:</b><br>         
         The consistency check of <code>nextCatalogID</code> must be
         skipped if <code>kHFSCatalogNodeIDsReusedBit</code> is set
         in the <code>attributes</code> field of the
         <a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/technotes/tn/tn1150.html#VolumeHeader">volume header</a>.</p>

<h3><a name="AllocationFileConsistencyCheck"></a>Allocation File
Consistency Check</h3>


         <p>For an HFS Plus volume to work correctly, it's vital that
         any allocation block in use by file system structures be
         marked as allocated in the allocation file. The algorithm to
         ensure this is as follows:</p>
         
         <ul>
            <li>The implementation must first walk the allocation
            file, marking every allocation block as free. (This step
            can be skipped to improve the performance of the
            consistency check. All that will happen is that some
            allocation blocks may have been marked as in-use, though
            they are not really in use by any extent.)</li>
            
            <li>The implementation must then mark the allocation
            blocks containing the first 1536 bytes and the last
            1024 bytes as allocated. These areas are either
            reserved or used by the <a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/technotes/tn/tn1150.html#VolumeHeader">volume
            header</a>.</li>
            
            <li>The implementation must then mark the allocation
            blocks used by all extents in all special files (the
            catalog file, the extents overflow file, the allocation
            file, the attributes file, and the startup file) as
            allocated. These extents are all described in the
            <a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/technotes/tn/tn1150.html#VolumeHeader">volume header</a>.</li>
            
            <li>The implementation must then walk the leaf nodes of
            the catalog file, marking all allocation blocks used by
            extents in file records (in the
            <code>HFSPlusForkData</code> structures for the data and
            resource forks).</li>
            
            <li>The implementation must then walk the leaf nodes of
            the <a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/technotes/tn/tn1150.html#ExtentsOverflowFile">extents overflow
            file</a>, marking all allocation blocks used by all
            extents in all extent records as allocated.</li>
            
            <li>The implementation must then walk the leaf nodes of
            the attributes file, marking all allocation blocks used
            by all extents described in fork data attributes and
            extension attributes as allocated.</li>
         </ul>
      
<center><table border="0" width="550">
<tbody><tr><td bgcolor="#E6E6E6">
<p><b>WARNING:</b><br>
         
         To prevent the loss of user data, an implementation must
         perform this check every time it mounts a volume that wasn't
         unmounted cleanly. It is most important that an allocation
         block that is in use be marked in the allocation file. It is
         less important that an allocation block that is not in use
         be cleared in the allocation file. If an allocation block is
         marked as in-use by the allocation file, but not actually in
         use by any extent, then that allocation block is really just
         wasting space; it isn't otherwise dangerous.</p>
